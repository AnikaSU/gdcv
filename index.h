/* We use radix tree to build index file.
 * The implementation  is based on the one of libkmod (interface to kernel module operations )
 * (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/kmod/kmod.git)
 *
 *
 * Few bugs are introduced.
 * First, all dictionary files with *dsl.dz extension are found in the given directories.
 * These files are read with gzread line by line, all words are going through Unicode normalization (utf8proc library is used).
 * The index  contains two files. index_value.db and index_key.
 *
 *
 *
 * Disk format for index_value.db:
 *
 *
 * char *word //null terminated 
 * all words are grouped by their unicode normalisation form, so: dog,DOG, DÃ¶g are in one group. 
 * To save space,  if a word is equal to the key then it is skipped.
 *
 *
 * char * dictionary_id:start_offset:end_offset: //null terminated
 * start_offset and end_offset are positions of the word translation in dictionary file.
 * The file is compressed with dictzip.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Disk format for index_key.db:
 *
 *  uint32_t magic = INDEX_MAGIC;
 *  uint32_t version = INDEX_VERSION;
 *
 *
 *  List of dictionaries:
 *
 *  uint32_t dictionary_id;
 *  char* basename;//null terminated
 *  char*  filename, abbreviation_file,icon,zip_file_with_resources,name,translation_from,translation_to; //null terminated
 *
 *
 *  uint32_t root_offset;
 *
 *  (node_offset & INDEX_NODE_MASK) specifies the file offset of nodes:
 *
 *       char[] prefix; // nul terminated
 *       
 *       unsigned char N; //number of childrens
 *       char children[N];
 *       uint32_t children[N];
 *
 *       unsigned char v_N; //number of values.
 *        
 *       long start; 
 *       long end; 
 *       start and end position for list of words similar to the key and the list of dictionaries in the file index_value.db
 *
 *
 *  (node_offset & INDEX_NODE_FLAGS) indicates which fields are present.
 *  Empty prefixes are omitted, leaf nodes omit the three child-related fields.
 *
 * Implementation is based on a radix tree, or "trie".
 * Each arc from parent to child is labelled with a character.
 * Each path from the root represents a string.
 *
 * == Example strings ==
 *
 * ask
 * ate
 * on
 * once
 * one
 *
 * == Key ==
 *  + Normal node
 *  * Marked node, representing a key and it's values.
 *
 * +
 * |-a-+-s-+-k-*
 * |   |
 * |   `-t-+-e-*
 * |
 * `-o-+-n-*-c-+-e-*
 *         |
 *         `-e-*
 *
 * Naive implementations tend to be very space inefficient; child pointers
 * are stored in arrays indexed by character, but most child pointers are null.
 *
 * Our implementation uses a scheme described by Wikipedia as a Patrica trie,
 *
 *     "easiest to understand as a space-optimized trie where
 *      each node with only one child is merged with its child"
 *
 * +
 * |-a-+-sk-*
 * |   |
 * |   `-te-*
 * |
 * `-on-*-ce-*
 *      |
 *      `-e-*
 *
 * We still use arrays of child pointers indexed by a single character;
 * the remaining characters of the label are stored as a "prefix" in the child.
 *
 * The paper describing the original Patrica trie works on individiual bits -
 * each node has a maximum of two children, which increases space efficiency.
 * However for this application it is simpler to use the ASCII character set.
 * Since the index file is read-only, it can be compressed by omitting null
 * child pointers at the start and end of arrays.
